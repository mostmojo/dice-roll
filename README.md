### Dice rolling game in HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript ðŸŽ²

**Game Rules**
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a pair of dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their **round** score.
- **But**, if the player rolls a 1, all of his/her **round** score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to **Hold**, which means that their **round** score gets added to their **global** score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on **global** score wins the game. You get to pick what happens to the loser! ðŸ˜‚ Tequila shot? Down a beer? Go to the shop? Pint(s) on them?
- Don't want to play to 100 points? Set winning score to something greater or less than 100. Ex. 20, and hit roll dice to start with new cap.

- **TIP**: Use **spacebar** to *roll dice* and **enter** to *hold* and `1` to start `new game`, if you don't want to use the mouse or trackpad ðŸ˜‰.
